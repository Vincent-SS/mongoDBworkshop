# mongoDBworkshop

Follow by UNSW CSE MongoDB Workshop. Went through the connection with MongoDB using Mongoose.

Please note .env is not included. In order to run the program, a .env file is required, with the mongoDB url link inside.

.enc file is needed for the connection of mongoDB. Inside the dotenv file, it should have MONGODB_CONNECT=mongodb+srv://{name}:{password}@cluster0.bvsyk.mongodb.net/....... (replace your url link here)
